# How to install dependencies and build the project

## Installation

This project assumes you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.

You will need to install [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) globally if you haven't already:

```bash
$ npm install -g typescript
```

You will also need something to bundle the JavaScript files generated by the TypeScript compiler so they can be
included in a web page.\
The `build.sh` script in this project uses the [Google Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler) to
do this - assumed to also be installed globally like so:

```bash
$ npm install -g google-closure-compiler
```

The project's local dependencies can now be installed by running:

```bash
$ npm install
```


## Building

After installing deependencies, the project can be built by running the following script:

```bash
$ ./build.sh
```

This will use Google closure compiler's default `SIMPLE` compilation level which builds faster but produces less
compact and less efficient code.\
For a "production" build we would want the best possible optimisation, and this can be selected by giving `ADVANCED` as
an argument to the build script:

```bash
$ ./build.sh ADVANCED
```

The script takes slightly longer to build using this option.

(`build.sh` is a bash script, so if you are on Windows it is probably easiest to use Git Bash which you may have
installed already as it comes bundled with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
